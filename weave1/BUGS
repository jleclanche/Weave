- Occasionally, Weave crashes after decoding a few packets, displaying
  the following error messages:
    
      weave: weave.c:558: msg_dump_all: Assertion `passes < 2048' failed.
      Aborted
  
  This assertion is a precaution against an infinite loop which cannot 
  be reliably reproduced so far.
  
  No solution or workaround is currently known, and Weave must be 
  restarted after this bug occurs.
