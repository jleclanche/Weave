Please see the file doc/html/index.html for detailed instructions on how to
install and use Weave.

In case you did a checkout from version control and want to get up and 
running for building Weave, you will need to install automake and 
autoconf. Once they are installed, run these commands:

    $ ./build-setup.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If Doxygen is installed, you can generate the documentation using:

    $ doxygen Doxyfile
